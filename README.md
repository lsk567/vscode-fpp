# VSCode-FPP

VSCode extension for FPP Language Support.

[FPP](https://github.com/nasa/fpp) is a modeling language for the [F Prime flight software framework](https://github.com/nasa/fprime).

## Get Started

For the extension to work, it needs a valid F´ build cache.  
1. Run `fprime-util generate`
2. Open a `.fpp` file. The project should start indexing and references should resolve.


### Troubleshooting
When first loading up your F Prime project, you may notice errors. This is because the compiler doesn't know
where to search for FPP declarations

You will need to load the locs files which is generated during build time in the cmake build folder. Look for `build-fprime-automatic-native/locs.fpp`.
If you do not have a `build-fprime-automatic-native/` folder, run `fprime-util generate`

Once the locs file is loaded, the entire project will be indexed and references
will be resolved.

It's recommended to 'pin' the reload status so that its easier to reload/reindex
the project:

This will add a status bar item that will reindex the locs file when clicked.

## Features

- Syntax highlighting
- Code completion
  - Syntax level completion
  - Semantic specific identifier lookup
    - When searching for a type, only types will be shown. Same goes for ports, components etc.
- Syntax Signature Display
  - This should pop up while you are typing but can be manually triggered, see [VSCode Docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-editing#_signature-help)

  - Includes descriptions on what each field does
- Hover information
  - Shows what references resolved to
- Go-to Reference (`Ctrl-Click`)
- Document Links
  - Used when referencing a file directly in FPP (for example the `instance` `at` specifier).

## Technical Description

This VSCode extension is essentially a FPP compiler frontend
written in TypeScript using ANTLR4. It injests a 'locs' file
generated during the FPrime build process which will tell the
compiler which files to include during its variable/type declaration
stage.

Files are parsed and reduced in a separate worker thread and then
sent through the compilers declaration collection in the main thread.

## Development instructions

To set up dependencies you will need NodeJS and a package manager like `npm` or `yarn`:

```
$ yarn install
```

When making a change to the ANTLR definition (`src/grammar/Fpp.g4`), you will need to regenerate
the generated files.

```
$ yarn antlr
```

To build the extension into bundled JavaScript:

```
$ yarn build
```

Once the extension is built, there should be an `out/` directory at the project root.
You can then test the extension by clicking "Run and Debug" and then clicking the run button on "Run Extension"
to launch an development VSCode environment.

To package the extension into a VSIX file you can use:
```
$ yarn package
```

This will generate a `.vsix` file, from which an extension can be installed in VSCode following instructions: [Install from a VSIX](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_install-from-a-vsix)

To clean the build artifacts, you can use:
```
$ yarn clean
```
